    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyrics</h3>
    <p><ol>I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
        Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface <br>
        I don't know what you're expecting of me <br>
        Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes</ol>
        
        <ul>Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
        <b>&nbsp;(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)</b></ul> 
        
        <ol>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
        Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
        I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
        Is be more like me and be less like you</ol></p>
    
    <p><ol>Can't you see that you're smothering me? <br>
        Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control <br>
        'Cause everything that you thought I would be <br>
        Has fallen apart right in front of you</ol>
        
        <ul>Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
        <b>&nbsp;(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)</b> <br>
        And every second I waste is more than I can take</ul>
        
        <ol>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
        Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
        I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
        Is be more like me and be less like you</ol></p>

    <p><ol>And I know <br>
        I may end up failing too <br>
        But I know <br>
        You were just like me, with someone disappointed in you</ol>
        
        <ol>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
        Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
        I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
        Is be more like me and be less like you</ol>
        
        <ol>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
        I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
        I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
        I'm tired of being what you want me to be</ol></p>
